This photo reminds me of a sense of calmness. The way the sun shines through the trees also allows for emotions of serenity and pleasantness. The carousel in the background also reminds me of childhood and the unique feeling of waking up on a beach vacation and having the possibility to explore a new place. Personally I am brought back to a family vacation I had in the Bahamas. Everyday was filled with sunshine and endless fun. Knowing that I had no school work, errands, or things to worry about was such a truly blissful feeling. There is nothing like being a kid and enjoying a vacation to its fullest. All my stresses would vanish.
